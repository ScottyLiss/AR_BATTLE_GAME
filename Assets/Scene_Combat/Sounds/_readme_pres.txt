BLASTERs - robot attacks obviously
IMPACTs - when you hit the enemy. you might want to try combining with a WHOOSH
MONSTER - sound when the monster gets hit (might not be needed, because the BLASTER sounds are enough?)
PLASMA CANNONs - different robot attack sounds
ROBOTIC - sounds for robot movement, and robot shutting down/turning off sounds
THUDs - alternate them for runing sound for monster? the best I could find for non-human footsteps.
WHOOSHes - maybe player attack should start with this, ending with an impact
